"""``weakref`` for threads.

Allows threads in Python to create "weak references" to themselves
that detect when the thread is no longer running, similar to how a
weak reference detects when its referent object is no longer alive.

Provides a lightweight way for one or more independent pieces of code
to register per-thread cleanup callbacks without coordination.
